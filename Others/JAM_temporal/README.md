# JAM Past Present Futur

The web version has been created by [Baptiste Martinet](https://github.com/BaptisteMartinet), while the appli version has been created by [Kevin Pruvost](https://github.com/kevinpruvost). My role was merely to provide images from different timelines, which I done using Google Maps.

The full project can be found on Kevin's repository [TempoGuessr](https://github.com/kevinpruvost/TempoGuessr).
